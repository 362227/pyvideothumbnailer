# .pyvideothumbnailer.conf
#
# Default configuration options for the Python Video Thumbnailer
#
# The configuration file uses the INI syntax of the Python Configuration parser.
# For reference, see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html
# The values assigned to the commented variables in the template configuration file
# correspond to the default values. Uncomment and edit the variables as needed.
#
# Note: Do not use quotes for string variables as the Python Configuration parser
#       regards them as belonging to the string-type variable.
#       Uncomment a variable and leave its value empty to define the Python value 'None'.

# Configuration options of the Python Video Thumbnailer are considered in the
# following order of precedence:
# 1. Arguments supplied on the command line
